*Built with ❤️ by WeekendWare*

Basil is a Kotlin Multiplatform app designed to make life with Type 1 diabetes a little easier—and a lot smarter. It’s not just another glucose log; it’s your co-pilot in the daily grind of chronic illness, built with empathy, intelligence, and an eye for good UX.

## 🔮 What’s Coming

We’re just getting started. Here’s what’s on the roadmap:

- 📊 **Insulin + carb logging** with intuitive inputs
- 🕰 **Automated trend analysis** (CGM-style without the CGM)
- 💡 **Smart suggestions** based on your patterns
- 📓 **Context-aware journaling** for meals, stress, sleep
- 🤖 **LLM-based assistant** trained to speak fluent T1D

## 🌱 Why Basil (Basal)?

Because living with T1D is hard enough—you deserve tools that *get it*.  
Not medical, not preachy—just helpful, beautiful, and on your side.
